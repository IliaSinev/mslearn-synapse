# Use SQL in Azure Databricks

SQL is an industry-standard language for querying and manipulating data. Many data analysts perform data analytics by using SQL to query tables in a relational database. Azure Databricks includes SQL functionality that builds on Spark and Delta Lake technologies to provide a relational database layer over files in a data lake.

This lab will take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

You'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have administrative-level access.

## Provision an Azure Databricks workspace

In this exercise, you'll use a script to provision a new Azure Databricks workspace.

1. In a web browser, sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
2. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment and creating storage if prompted. The cloud shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal, as shown here:

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, use the the drop-down menu at the top left of the cloud shell pane to change it to ***PowerShell***.

3. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the pane, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#9723;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the pane to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

4. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following commands to clone this repo:

    ```
    rm -r dp-000 -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-synapse dp-000
    ```

5. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.ps1** script it contains:

    ```
    cd dp-000/Allfiles/Labs/93
    ./setup.ps1
    ```

6. If prompted, choose which subscription you want to use (this will only happen if you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions).

7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5 minutes, but in some cases may take longer. While you are waiting, review the [What is Databricks SQL?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/scenarios/what-is-databricks-sql) article in the Azure Databricks documentation.

## Delete Azure Databricks resources

Now you've finished exploring Delta Lake in Azure Databricks, you must delete the resources you've created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs and free up capacity in your subscription.

1. Close the Azure Databricks workspace browser tab and return to the Azure portal.
2. On the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
3. Select the **dp000-*xxxxxxx*** resource group (not the managed resource group), and verify that it contains your Azure Databricks workspace.
4. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
5. Enter the **dp000-*xxxxxxx*** resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.

    After a few minutes, your resource group and the managed workspace resource groups associated with it will be deleted.
