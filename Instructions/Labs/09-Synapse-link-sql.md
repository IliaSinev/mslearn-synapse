# Use Azure Synapse Link for SQL

Azure Synapse Link for SQL enables you to automatically synchronize a transactional database in SQL Server or Azure SQL Database with a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics. This synchronization enables you to perform low-latency analytical workloads in Synapse Analytics without incurring query overhead in the source operational database.

This lab will take approximately **35** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

You'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have administrative-level access.

## Provision Azure resources

In this exercise, you'll synchronize data from an Azure SQL Database resource to an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. You'll start by using a script to provision these resources in your Azure subscription.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment and creating storage if prompted. The cloud shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal, as shown here:

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, use the the drop-down menu at the top left of the cloud shell pane to change it to ***PowerShell***.

3. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the pane, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#9723;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the pane to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

4. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following commands to clone this repo:

    ```
    rm -r dp-000 -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-synapse dp-000
    ```

5. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the **setup.ps1** script it contains:

    ```
    cd dp-000/Allfiles/Labs/09
    ./setup.ps1
    ```

6. If prompted, choose which subscription you want to use (this will only happen if you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions).
7. When prompted, enter a suitable password for your Azure SQL Database.

    > **Note**: Be sure to remember this password!

8. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 15 minutes, but in some cases may take longer. While you are waiting, review the [What is Azure Synapse Link for SQL?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/synapse-link/sql-synapse-link-overview) article in the Azure Synapse Analytics documentation.
